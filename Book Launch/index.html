        <h3>
        Rusty is saving every penny earned working as a bank teller in Silverton, Colorado to marry Lenora and get out of town. When threatened by mobsters from Denver to repay a former moonshining partner’s debt, not only Rusty’s but Lenora’s lives are placed in danger.
            <br>
            <br>

            Rusty must find the money—legally or otherwise, and will stop at nothing to keep Lenora safe. In the process he realizes that losing his relationship with Lenora is worth saving her life.
<br>
            Rusty must decide how to resolve the situation, defining what doing the right thing is under extreme circumstances.
